# Privacy Protection

Known LG ACR, voice, telemetry/ad and discovery service blockers, with a local protection log.

**Public experimental release 1.0.2.** This repository contains only this module, its build tools and its installable ZIP. Unknown Core is a separate prerequisite; the legacy unkndigital/unknown-home repository is not the modular Core installer.

## Prerequisites

- Install only on a TV you own, with existing owner-controlled root and Unknown Core 0.4.6 or newer. No rooting exploit, LG credentials, firmware or service-login bypass is supplied.
- Keep independent recovery access and backups. Modules execute trusted code with root privileges; they are not sandboxed.
- Read [module behavior and restoration](MODULE.md), [owner-use boundaries](OWNER_USE.md), and [security limits](SECURITY.md).

## Build

On Windows, run **Build.cmd**. It checks Node.js 20+ and npm, installs locked dependencies, checks source and creates a validated module ZIP. It does not connect to a TV or publish anything.

    npm ci --ignore-scripts
    npm test
    npm run build

Output: dist/privacy-protection-1.0.2.zip and dist/SHA256SUMS.txt. PC architecture is independent of the TV JavaScript runtime. The initial reviewed candidate ZIP and its checksum are also at the repository root. Checksums verify bytes, not publisher identity or safety.

## Install

In Core, choose Install Modules from GitHub and enter https://github.com/unkndigital/unknown-module-privacy-protection. Select the module ZIP from Releases, inspect it and review before installing. Activation is a separate choice. No GitHub account or credentials are needed on the TV. Alternatively, transfer the module ZIP to /media/internal/.unknown-core/modules-inbox through your owner-controlled connection. Use the module ZIP, not GitHub's automatic source-code ZIP.

## Scope and Verification

Removes this module's temporary service blocks, allowing those LG services to run again. Saved preferences and logs are retained. Microphone Protection depends on this module and must be turned off first.

Only one LG C4 / webOS 25 owner-device has been used for integration checks. Other models and firmware versions are unverified. Workspace tests cover module contracts; this standalone build checks syntax, manifest rules and archive integrity without executing TV actions. A successful build is not proof of hardware compatibility. No TV logs, personal settings, keys, research payloads or private YouTube helper are included.
